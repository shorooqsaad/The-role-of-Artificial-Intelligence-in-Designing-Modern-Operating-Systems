# The-role-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Designing-Modern-Operating-Systems
In this report, we discuss a real benefit provided to modern operating systems. This report covers 
many fields and components in operating systems enhanced by AI, such as Fuzzy Logic Systems, 
Natural Language Processing, Machine reasoning, Neural Network, Machine learning, and Deep 
Learning. Thus, the components that have been enhanced by the previous method are Main 
Memory, GUI, Network, Protection, and Security, with an example for each.
